## **_Coyote Creek Field Station Study Organism or Phenomenon_**

The dataset for team DataKnights is of the Coyote Creek Field Station (CCFS). The San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory is a non-profit bird conservation organization that currently operates the Coyote Creek Field Station (CCFS). The Coyote Creek Field Station is a banding station that operates year-round and was established in 1982. CCFS focuses on the various species of birds and make observations on the patterns of bird population, migration, breeding, wintering, etc. There are various aspects of bird banding research and this background research will give you an overview of some species that we will be working on for our further analysis. 
### What is bird banding?
Bird banding is a technique used to identify various species of birds and keep a track of them. Bird banding helps in the study of birds and it is regulated by the U.S. federal government. Scientists put a colored band on the birds’ legs which represents a unique number. This helps to identify the bird and maintain a record of each. Colored bands also help them to differentiate the bird without catching them again. These bands are light-weight and cost efficient. 
### How is bird banding done?
Birds are captured using fine threaded mist-nets which are mainly used to catch small birds. Once they are caught, researchers record data of each bird. Information like its species, gender, age, fat, weight, feather wear, wing length, etc. is recorded. These birds are then banded and released. These banded birds are studied again when recaptured, to determine the distance they migrated, their life, their breeding habits and so on. 
According to Coyote Creek Field Station, in the last decade, they have captured and banded an average of 2,150 birds per year. 815 of which were recaptured multiple times while the average recapture record was 1,525 per year. Currently, 58 species are newly captured out of which 38 are recaptured annually. 
There are various aspects of research when it comes to the various species of birds, namely, breeding condition, brood patch, cloacal protuberance, age, age ratios, molt indicators, body molt, wing molt, species trends, guild trends, habitat trends, etc.
### Breeding Condition: 
Breeding condition depends on the following factors of brood patch, cloacal protuberance and age of the species. 
### Brood Patch: 
All the species of birds incubate their eggs to keep them warm while a chick develops. This incubation is done by transferring body heat to the eggs, which is done using a brood patch. A brood patch is nothing but the belly of a bird, which loses its feathers on that part. This bare skin is swollen and wrinkly. The belly is swollen with a fluid, edema. Brood patch is a female reproductive indicator. Brood patches usually begin to develop during bird nesting so they help to identify the breeding stage of a bird. Some male species also incubate. 
### Cloacal Protuberance:
Cloacal Protuberance is also another factor for determining the breeding stage. It is a male reproductive indicator. Cloacal protuberance is a bird’s swollen cloaca. During the breeding season cloacal protuberance is high and at the end of the breeding season it recedes back to normal. 
### Age and Age ratios:
The bird’s hatching year is used to identify a bird’s age. An age ratio is the ratio of unique juvenile birds compared to unique adult birds. Juvenile birds can be mostly identified by their appearance and plumage quality. ‘Pluma’ stands for ‘feather’ in Latin. Plumage indicates the layers, patterns, color and arrangement of the feathers. Juvenile plumage is generally different from that of an adult plumage. The juvenile plumage is more spotted as compared to the adult and also comparatively duller. This plumage comparison allows to identify first or hatch-year birds from the adult ones. 
### Molt indicators: 
Feathers have a temporary structure, thus replaced and shed. The process of feather replacement and shedding of worn feathers is called molting. Most birds undergo molting during summer and early fall. Body molt and wing molt are molt indicators which also represent the replacement of feathers that birds undergo every year. Multiple molts in a year indicate birds have taken long migrations or been in harsh habitats. The period and number of molts differs from one species to another. Molting also depends on various factors like habitats, breeding cycles and the type of species (sedentary or migratory). Birds make sure that molting, breeding and migration do not overlap. Smaller species molt once or twice per year. Huge birds replace their feathers in intervals taking multiple years. 
#### Body molt:
Body molt is molting on the bird’s body. Body molt is a replacement of feathers on the body except the flight feathers. The wing and tail feathers include the flight feathers.
#### Wing molt:
Wing molt refers to molting or replacement of the flight feathers, wing and tail feathers. 
### Species trends: 
Species trend is nothing but the change in species population over certain periods. eBird is an idea which documents various aspects of bird in the form of checklists and documents. This document includes information like bird distribution, trends, habitat use, abundance, etc. 
### Guild trends: 
Guild refers to grouping of species based on their related categories or species that use similar resources in the same manner.  This helps in determining factors that can affect a group of species due to the same reason or in the same way. Guilds can be categorized into foraging behavior or migratory behavior. 
#### Foraging guilds:
This includes species with similar foraging behavior with similarities in food habits, foraging patterns and feeding behavior. There can be several classifications for guild trends like, foraging substrate (example: aerial, bark, water, foliage, ground), foraging habitat, diet (example: granivore, frugivore, insectivore), foraging behavior and activity period (example: diurnal, nocturnal). 
#### Diet guild: 
This category includes exudativore (sap), nectarivore (nectar), granivore (seeds), folivore (non-fruit or seed plant material, flowers, buds), carnivore (animal matter), frugivore (fruit), insectivore (insects), omnivore and scavenger (dead animal matter).
#### Migratory guilds:
In the CCFS data migratory guilds include three categories. 
#### Temperate: 
A migratory species that predominately winters north of Chiapas, Mexico. Species with an expansive temperate winter distribution which extends into Central America and/or northern South America were considered Temperate migrants (e.g., CEDW). Species with both year-round and migratory populations occurring in the San Francisco Bay and/or greater region were classified as temperate migrants.
#### Neotropical:
A migratory species that predominately winters south of Oaxaca, MEX on the Yucatan Peninsula, Antilles, Central America, and/or South America. A Neotropical species' winter range may extend north of Oaxaca, but it is generally restricted to areas south of Jalisco and San Luis Potosi, MEX, and more approximately more than half of their winter range is within the Neotropics. 
#### Resident:
A species that predominately occurs year-round in the San Francisco Bay and/or greater region. Species that resident in the region but are seasonally or irregularly present at CCFS whether within or outside of any of their respective migration periods. Wintering species that also have transient populations occurring at CCFS and/or the greater region were considered resident if the proportion of transients was small and/or the number of wintering individuals was substantial. 
## Conclusion: 
For our team research we will be studying all the above factors of different species and analyzing the required data. One aspect that we are trying to analyze is the weight and fat of the species. Wing and weight are likely to be correlated within a species and will differ by sex. Fat depends on the time of year. For juvenile birds that are very recently fledged and still dependent on their adults, fat can be a good indicator of how well the adults are able to feed them and how healthy they are. During the non-migratory seasons, fat may be a good indicator of how much food a bird is getting. During migration, birds will pack on fat right before they migrate, and will exhaust their supplies by the time they land to refuel. Fat values in this case are more of an indicator of what migratory stage the bird is in. As the data is given for a vast number of species, we will be focusing on 5 species that CCFS have at their station. Their abundant species are, Song Sparrow (SOSP), Common Yellowthroat (COYE), Bewick's Wren (BEWR), Bushtit (BUSH) and Chestnut-backed Chickadee (CBCH).
